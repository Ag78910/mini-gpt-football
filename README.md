# Mini GPT Football âš½

This project is an interactive Jupyter notebook that uses a language model to analyze football (soccer) match events from textual descriptions.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files

- `Mini_GPT_Football_UPDATED.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code and explanations.
- `football_dataset.txt`: A dataset with descriptions of football match actions and events.

## ðŸ§  What Does This Project Do?

The notebook follows a pipeline to:
- Read and explore a dataset of football events.
- Apply basic text processing techniques.
- Identify patterns or generate predictions using natural language processing (NLP) methods.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files manually.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter.
4. Before running the notebook, ensure `football_dataset.txt` is in the same folder.

You can also download the dataset directly:
