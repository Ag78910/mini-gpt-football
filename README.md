# Mini GPT Football âš½

This project is an interactive Jupyter notebook that uses a language model to analyze football (soccer) match events from textual descriptions.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files

- `Mini_GPT_Football.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code and explanations.
- `football_dataset_en.zip`: A zipped dataset with descriptions of football match actions and events (in English).
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python packages.

## ðŸ§  What Does This Project Do?

The notebook follows a pipeline to:
- Read and explore a dataset of football events.
- Apply basic text processing techniques.
- Identify patterns or generate predictions using natural language processing (NLP) methods.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files manually.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Unzip `football_dataset_en.zip` and place `football_dataset_en.txt` in the same folder as the notebook.
4. Open `Mini_GPT_Football.ipynb` in Jupyter and run the cells.
